Wraps the RESTful [Trefle API](https://trefle.io/) in GraphQL.

## graphql-user-api
This repo is based upon [`graphql-user-api`](https://github.com/joeynimu/graphql-user-api): a graphql based API that resolves using a REST API. The purpose of `graphql-user-api` is to show how devs and organizations can start using graphql with the least effort possible and no re-writing their existing infrastructure.
